## Security

While there shouldn't be any risk of vulnerabilities, I still want to be serious about security in general, so here are ways to help out if there is a vulnerability.


## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of my repositories, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send a DM on Discord to .grant7777.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
  * Anything else that isn't in this lists

This information will help us _triage_ your report more quickly.
